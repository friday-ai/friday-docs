# Friday documentation

### What is Friday ? 

Friday is an ultra-light and open source assistant. Designed for home automation, it consumes very little resources and is installed on a home server, a raspberry or any other type of computer compatible with Docker. Modern, simple and extremely customizable, it is compatible with many objects connected to the market.

### Usage

As a home automation assistant Friday can:

* Manage the light point
* Serve as an alarm
* Manage your heating
* Manage music in multiroom
* Manage the presence or absence of users
* Run scenes in a completely autonomous way

And much more ðŸ˜‰

### Why ?

Why create Friday? Simply because we like doing things by ourselves and we like to control our data \(with Friday everything stays on YOUR machine\). Because we also want to create a modern, flexible, powerful and easy-to-use assistant.

Why did you choose "Friday"? There are two reasons for this, the first is that the project was born on a friday and the second is that we are all fans of Iron Man and his intelligent assistant ... ðŸ˜Ž

### Demo
